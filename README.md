# Predicting-House-Prices-Kaggle

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on various house features. The solution demonstrates exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of regression models to achieve accurate predictions.

Project Overview
The project follows these main steps:

Data Exploration: Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, missing values, and key features.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical data, and engineer additional features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train various regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, and XGBoost, to determine the most effective approach.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune models using cross-validation and grid search to optimize performance.
Evaluation: Use RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the evaluation metric to gauge model performance.
